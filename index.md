Welcome to my homepage.

Iâ€™m currently a PhD candidate in The University of Hong Kong (HKU). My research interests focus on the discrete/continuum modelling of granular flows in natural and industrial context, such as debris flow and grain segregation.

I use discrete element method, volume of fluid method, computational fluid dynamics and develop a framework coupling all of these components. I also perform laboratory experiments to understand the behavior of grain-water mixtures.
