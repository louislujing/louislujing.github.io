Welcome to my research homepage.

I'm a postdoc at Northwestern University [[cv](cv)]. My research aims to deepen our fundamental understanding of the physics and mechanics of granular materials. Current research interests include understanding the physics of granular phenomena in geophysical and industrial settings; modeling complex flow behaviors of geological and granular materials; and fast, multiscale discrete and/or continuum computational methods. See [this page](research) for more details of my research. A full list of my publications can be found [here](publications).
