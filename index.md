Welcome to my research homepage.

I'm a postdoc at Northwestern University [[cv](cv)]. My current research interests are understanding the physics of granular phenomena in geophysical and industrial settings; modeling complex flow behaviors of geological and granular materials; and fast, large-scale numerical methods involving discrete and/or continuum approaches. See [this page](projects) for more details of my research. A full list of my publications can be found [here](publications).
