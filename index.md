Welcome to my research homepage.

My research is focused on the fundamental mechanics of granular flows and fluid-particle interactions, aiming to provide scientifically based solutions for geohazard mitigation and sediment management across fluvial and coastal environments.

See [this page](research) for more details of my research. A full list of my publications can be found [here](publications).
