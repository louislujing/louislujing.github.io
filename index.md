Welcome to my homepage.

I obtained my PhD in The University of Hong Kong (HKU). Iâ€™m interested in the physics of granular flows in both natural and industrial context. I use discrete and continuum numerical methods, along with laboratory experiments, to understand the behavior of a large variety of grain-fluid mixtures.
