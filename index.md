Welcome to my homepage.

I'm a postdoc in Northwestern University, prior to which I obtained my PhD in 2017 from The University of Hong Kong. I study the physics of granular flows in both geophysical and industrial settings. I use discrete and continuum numerical methods, along with laboratory experiments.
