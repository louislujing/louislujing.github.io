We study the flow and transport of granular materials (soil, sediment, ice) and other related phenomena in nature and engineering using a multiscale approach (from particle- to continuum-scale mechanics) combining experiments, simulations, and theory. The overarching theme is "Multi-Scale Mechanics for Earth and its Environment", in line with the UN's and China's sustainable development goals. Our ultimate goal is to promote scientific solutions for geohazard mitigation, sediment management, and ecological restoration in fluvial and coastal environments.
