Welcome to my research homepage.

I'm a postdoc at Northwestern University [[cv][1]]. 
My current research interests include understanding the physics of granular phenomena in geophysical and industrial settings; modeling complex flow behaviors of geological and granular materials; and fast, large-scale numerical methods involving discrete and/or continuum approaches. See [this page][2] for more details of my research.
