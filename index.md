Welcome to my research homepage.

Flow and transport of granular materials (soil, sediment, ice) lie at the heart of many natural and engineering processes that are crucial to our infrastructural and environmental needs. My research is therefore focused on the fundamental mechanics of granular materials and particle-laden flows through an interdisciplinary lens of mechanics, physics, and geoscience. The ultimate goal of my research is to promote scientifically based solutions for geohazard mitigation and sediment management across fluvial and coastal environments.
