One way that a granular flow differs from ordinary fluids is that its dynamics depends
largely on the conditions at solid boundaries. For instance, the minimum thickness
necessary to sustain a steady flow is a function of base roughness;
the slip occurring at the base can modify the bulk rheological behavior, which changes
the disorder flow state to a crystallized structure. Such a complicated dependency on solid boundaries in
granular flows contrasts with the simple non-slip boundary condition in ordinary fluids.

Common boundary conditions at the base include flat, bumpy, and erodible bases, among wihch the bumpy base attracts most
attentions in both experimental and numerical studies of granular flows.

The bumpiness of a boundary made of glued/fix particles depends not only on the
size ratio between base and flow particles, but also the packing and layering of the
base particles. The situation becomes more complicated if bi-dispersity exists in the bulk
flows, which changes the relative roughness as segregation takes place.

In the continuum modeling of granular flows, the boundary condition is an important closure
to the governing equations, which requirs the knowledge of slip/non-slip condition.

This project aims to understand the effect of base roughness in granular flows. The
geometric roughness of a base made of spheres is first characterized, with a wide range
of particle size and packing arrangement {% cite jing_characterization_2016 %}; link is [here][1].


<!-- To study the base roughness encountered in the modeling of granular flows. -->
<!-- 
Why important
- base roughness is important; boundary condition is difficult in granular flow

The dynamics of granular flows depend significantly on the nature of their boundaries. Geometric roughness at the base, 

- an important closure to the modeling of granular flow
- affect static-dynamic transition; affect segregation (feedback effect)
