This research aims to understand the dynamics of immersed granular flow. We use both coarse-grid and fully-resolved fluid-particle coupling approaches, combined with small-scale laboratory experiments, to look at granular column collapses in a viscous fluid.

Many parameters control the dynamics of immersed granular flow, including particle size, particle density, fluid density, fluid viscosity, column aspect ratio {% cite jing_dynamics_2018 %} and column packing density {% cite yang_pore_2020 %}. We are seeking for dimensionless parameters combining the effects of all these parameters, which are expect to capture different flow regimes where distinct flow dynamics are observed {% cite jing_flow_2019 %}.
