This research aims to understand the dynamics of immersed granular flow. We use both coarse-grid and fully-resolved fluid-particle coupling approaches, combined with small-scale laboratory experiments, to look at granular column collapse problem in fluid.

Many parameters control the dynamics of immersed granular flow, including particle size, particle density, fluid density, fluid viscosity, column aspect ratio and column packing density. We are seeking for dimensionless parameters combining the effects of all these parameters, which are expect to capture different flow regimes where distinct flow dynamics are observed.
