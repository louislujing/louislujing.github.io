This research aims to advance fundamental understanding of granular segregation at the particle level and enhance predictive modeling of size and/or density segregation in various flow configurations.

The first result is how large and small particles migrate at the particle scale, hinting at completely different physics {% cite jing_micromechanical_2017 %}.

Now at Northwestern, the force driving size and density segregation at the single intruder limit is being characterized using a virtual spring-based force meter in numerical simulations. A simple scaling law is proposed, which enables the first <em>a priori</em> prediction of rising and sinking of large intruders in free surface granular flows {% cite jing_rising_2020 %}.
