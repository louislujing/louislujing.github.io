This research aims to advance fundamental understanding of granular segregation at the particle level and enhance predictive modeling of size and/or density segregation in various flow configurations.

The first result is particle-scale mechanisms of how large and small particles migrate, which exhibit completely different physics; see [this article][1] for more details.

Currently, the force driving size and density segregation at the single intruder limit is being characterized using a virtual spring-based force meter in numerical simulations. A simple scaling law is proposed, which enables the first <em>a priori</em> prediction of rising and sinking of large intruders in free surface granular flows. This [result][2] is currently under review.
