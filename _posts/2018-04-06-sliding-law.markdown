Characterization of slip velocity for granular flows over inclines of different geometric roughness, ranging from flat to bumpy. Modeling the frictional boundary behaviors as rate-dependent sliding laws; that is, the basal shear stress is proportional to the basal normal stress by a factor (i.e., the basal friction coefficient) that depends on local shear rates.

<!-- This project aims to understand the effect of base roughness in granular flows. The
geometric roughness of a base made of spheres is first characterized, with a wide range
of particle size and packing arrangement (check out [here][1]).
