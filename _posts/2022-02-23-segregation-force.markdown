This research aims to advance fundamental understanding of granular segregation at the particle level and enhance predictive modeling of size and/or density segregation across various flow configurations.

The first result is how large and small particles migrate at the particle scale, hinting at completely different physics {% cite jing_micromechanical_2017 %}. Based on this microscopic understanding, a bottom-up theoretical model is developed to describe the net force driving segregation in terms of particle properties (size ratio, density ratio) and local flow conditions (pressure, shear rate, and their gradients), which unifies two major driving mechanisms of segregation â€“ gravity and shear-induced gradients {% cite jing_unified_2021 %}. The force model is shown to accurately predict the segregation direction, over a wide range of conditions, in various flow configurations {% cite jing_rising_2020 jing_unified_2021 %}. Recently, our model is extended to provide closure relations for segregation modeling in continuum granular flow theories {% cite duan_segregation_2022 %}.

The findings are expected to serve as the backbone of radically new methods for predicting and even controlling segregation in industrial and geophysical applications.
