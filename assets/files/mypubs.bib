		<p>Mudflows tend to deposit after a rapid evolution on the steep channel down hillside. The large runout distance and deposit area are crucial concerns of geotechnical and geological engineers. In the rheological point of view, mudflows are non-Newtonian viscoplastic fluids which behave like a solid until submitted to a higher stress than the yield strength. Upon yielding, flow takes place and the flow behavior is described by viscosity. How viscosity and yield stress control the deposition of mudflows remains yet unclear due to the difficulties of performing large-scale experiments and scaling over a wide range of length scales.</p>
		<p>In this work, scaling of rheological parameters are proposed in a dimensional analysis. It is successfully used in numerical simulations to bridge the depositional behaviors of mudflows at different scales. The numerical modeling with Bingham and Herschel-Bulkley models are validated against small-scale flume experiments (Figure 1). The depositional mechanism of mudflows is associated with yield stress and viscosity. It is found that a deposition of slurry relevant to natural mudflows has the following features: (i) fast runout and stoppage due to relatively low viscosity; (ii) elongated shape due to fast runout (more stream-wise spreading than lateral spreading); (iii) remains stuck on the channel and steep edges due to high yield stress; (iv) flat deposit surface due to the effect of yield stress.</p>},
