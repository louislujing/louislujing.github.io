	A coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics and Discrete Element Method (CFD-DEM) model is presented for fluid-particle flows with free fluid surface. The fluid flow is modeled by solving the locally averaged Navier-Stokes equations, and the particle motions are captured separately in the DEM. Fluid-particle interactions are taken into consideration by exchanging necessary information between the CFD and the DEM. A numerical solver, referred to as cfdemSolverVOF in this study, is developed to capture the dynamics of the free fluid surface within the CFD-DEM framework. This is achieved by applying an advection equation to solve the volume fraction of the liquid in each fluid cell, in the spirit of the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method. Different components of the developed numerical solver are verified and validated in the dam break case and sedimentation of particle tests. The numerical predictions agree well with the analytical/empirical solutions.

	Three-dimensional DEM simulations of size segregation in granular flows down chute are presented. Different cubic bi-disperse samples are generated by pluviation, on the rough base formed by randomly placed particles. Periodic boundaries are applied to the flow direction and the two sides. Parametrical studies involving slope angle, width, volume fraction, and coefficient of friction are systemically performed. In all presented cases, steady, fully developed (SFD) state is achieved, where the kinetic energy and fractional volume distribution remain constant. From the macroscopic view, segregations are completed in the SFD state with slightly different extents and a thick layer of pure coarse grains appears on the top of the flow. The profiles of volume fractions are calculated and presented by shear layers. In addition, the trajectories of individual particles are tracked and analysed, showing clearly the contact conditions and shear history experienced by individual particles. It is found that the connectivity of small particles is generally at a lower level than that of the large ones, indicating a high probability of small particles dropping into voids under gravity is higher. On the other hand, the large particles experience a significant increase of connectivity as they migrate through the layer of small particles.

	Computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method (CFD–DEM) is extended with the volume of fluid (VOF) method to model free-surface flows. The fluid is described on coarse CFD grids by solving locally averaged Navier–Stokes equations, and particles are modelled individually in DEM. Fluid–particle interactions are achieved by exchanging information between DEM and CFD. An advection equation is ap- plied to solve the phase fraction of liquid, in the spirit of VOF, to capture the dynamics of free fluid surface. It also allows inter-phase volume replacements between the fluid and solid particles. Further, as the size ratio (SR) of fluid cell to particle diameter is limited (i.e. no less than 4) in coarse-grid CFD–DEM, a porous sphere method is adopted to permit a wider range of particle size without sacrificing the resolution of fluid grids. It makes use of more fluid cells to calculate local porosities. The developed solver (cfdemSolverVOF) is validated in different cases. A dam break case validates the CFD-component and VOF-component. Particle sedimentation tests validate the CFD–DEM interaction at various Reynolds numbers. Water-level rising tests validate the volume exchange among phases. The porous sphere model is validated in both static and dynamic situations. Sensitivity analyses show that the SR can be reduced to 1 using the porous sphere approach, with the accuracy of analyses maintained. This allows more details of the fluid phase to be revealed in the analyses and enhances the applicability of the proposed model to geotechnical problems, where a highly dynamic fluid velocity and a wide range of particle sizes are encountered.

	Base roughness plays an important role in the dynamics of granular flows but is still poorly understood due to the difficulty of its quantification. For a bumpy base made of spheres, at least two factors should be considered in order to characterize its geometric roughness, namely, the size ratio of flow to base particles and the packing arrangement of base particles. In this paper, we propose an alternative definition of base roughness, $R_a$, as a function of both the size ratio and the distribution of base particles. This definition is generalized for random and regular packings of multilayered spheres. The range of possible values of $R_a$ is presented, and optimal arrangements for maximizing base roughness are studied. Our definition is applied to granular chute flows in both two- and three-dimensional configurations, and is shown to successfully predict whether slip occurs at the base. A transition is observed from slip to nonslip conditions as $R_a$ increases. Critical values of $R_a$ are identified for the construction of a nonslip base at various angles of inclination.

	The basal condition for granular chute flows is assumed rough and non-slip in experimental and numerical studies. In mono-disperse flows, a rough base is usually constructed by gluing/fixing a layer of particles that is similar or identical to the flowing particles. However, the base condition is not so clear in bi-disperse flows, where size segregation changes the relative basal roughness. In this paper, basal effect is studied in both mono- and bi-disperse chute flows. Different size ratios are adopted to understand how size segregation affects the basal condition and velocity profile in the steady, fully developed state. It is found that considerable sliding may arise as large particles stay in contact with the base, and it may affect the development of segregation. The velocity profile at the steady state is different due to the occurrence of segregation. In addition, sensitivity analyses show that the basal effect is independent of the sample size and contact parameters.

		<p>Mudflows tend to deposit after a rapid evolution on the steep channel down hillside. The large runout distance and deposit area are crucial concerns of geotechnical and geological engineers. In the rheological point of view, mudflows are non-Newtonian viscoplastic fluids which behave like a solid until submitted to a higher stress than the yield strength. Upon yielding, flow takes place and the flow behavior is described by viscosity. How viscosity and yield stress control the deposition of mudflows remains yet unclear due to the difficulties of performing large-scale experiments and scaling over a wide range of length scales.</p>
		<p>In this work, scaling of rheological parameters are proposed in a dimensional analysis. It is successfully used in numerical simulations to bridge the depositional behaviors of mudflows at different scales. The numerical modeling with Bingham and Herschel-Bulkley models are validated against small-scale flume experiments. The depositional mechanism of mudflows is associated with yield stress and viscosity. It is found that a deposition of slurry relevant to natural mudflows has the following features: (i) fast runout and stoppage due to relatively low viscosity; (ii) elongated shape due to fast runout (more stream-wise spreading than lateral spreading); (iii) remains stuck on the channel and steep edges due to high yield stress; (iv) flat deposit surface due to the effect of yield stress.</p>},
