    <p>We introduce the open-source package MercuryDPM, which we have been developing over the last few years. MercuryDPM is a code for discrete particle simulations. It simulates the motion of particles by applying forces and torques that stem either from external body forces, (gravity, magnetic fields, etc.) or particle interactions. The code has been developed extensively for granular applications, and in this case these are typically (elastic, plastic, viscous, frictional) contact forces or (adhesive) short-range forces. However, it could be adapted to include long-range (molecular, self-gravity) interactions as well. MercuryDPM is an object-oriented algorithm with an easy-to-use user interface and a flexible core, allowing developers to quickly add new features. It is parallelised using MPI and released under the BSD 3-clause licence. Its open-source developers’ community has developed many features, including moving and curved walls; state-of-the-art granular contact models; specialised classes for common geometries; non-spherical particles; general interfaces; restarting; visualisation; a large self-test suite; extensive documentation; and numerous tutorials and demos. In addition, MercuryDPM has three major components that were originally invented and developed by its team: an advanced contact detection method, which allows for the first time large simulations with wide size distributions; curved (non-triangulated) walls; and multicomponent, spatial and temporal coarse-graining, a novel way to extract continuum fields from discrete particle systems. We illustrate these tools and a selection of other MercuryDPM features via various applications, including size-driven segregation down inclined planes, rotating drums, and dosing silos.</p>

    <p>The collapse of granular columns in a viscous fluid is a common model case for submarine geophysical flows. In immersed granular collapses, dense packings result in slow dynamics and short runout distances, while loose packings are associated with fast dynamics and long runout distances. However, the underlying mechanisms of the collapse initiation and runout, particularly regarding the complex fluid-particle interactions at the pore scale, are yet to be fully understood. In this study, a three-dimensional approach coupling the lattice Boltzmann method and the discrete element method is adopted to investigate the influence of packing density on the collapsing dynamics. As a supplement to previous experimental measurements, the direct numerical simulation of fluid-particle interactions explicitly provides micromechanical evidence of the pore pressure feedback mechanism. In dense cases, a strong arborescent contact force network can form to prevent particles from sliding, resulting in a creeping failure behavior. In contrast, the granular phase is liquefied substantially in loose cases, leading to a rapid and catastrophic failure. This opposing dilative/contractive behavior linked to the initial packing is robust and does not depend on the column size. Furthermore, hydroplaning can take place in large enough loose cases due to the fast-moving surge front, which reduces the frictional resistance dramatically and thereby results in a long runout distance. More quantitatively, we are able to linearly correlate the normalized runout distance and the densimetric Froude number across a wide range of length scales, including small-scale numerical/experimental data and large-scale field data.</p>

    <p>This paper presents a parametric study of a fluid-particle model which couples Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) and Discrete Element Method (DEM) using an immersed moving boundary technique. Benchmark cases with increasing complexity are simulated to understand the numerical accuracy, stability and efficiency of the algorithm. A guideline for a high-quality LBM-DEM model is proposed and applied to a test case of granular collapse in water. The simulation result shows excellent agreement with a companion experiment, which demonstrates the capability of LBM-DEM to describe the dynamics of densely packed and friction dominant immersed granular flows, highlighting its potential to study geophysical mass movements.</p>

    <p>Immersed granular collapses may encounter different ﬂow regimes, such as free-fall (dry), ﬂuid-inertial, and viscous regimes, depending on column geometry, particle size, particle density, ﬂuid viscosity, and many other parameters. Understanding the controlling parameters of these regimes is important for both industrial and geological applications where grains and ﬂuids coexist. It is also important to combine these parameters into dimensionless groups to guide down-scaled experiments and numerical simulations. In this work, we derive a set of dimensionless numbers (i.e., Stokes number, density ratio, and Reynolds number) based on typical time scales in the sedimentation of a sphere, and successfully verify the relevance of these numbers in determining ﬂow regimes and maintaining dynamic similitude across length scales. The numerical method we use couples the computational ﬂuid dynamics and discrete element method (CFD-DEM), which allows a wide variety of particle size and ﬂuid viscosity to be chosen, keeping constant the Stokes number and density ratio. Quantitative data of front propagation and energy evolution are presented to characterize ﬂow dynamics in different ﬂow regimes. The collapse exhibits a transition from sliding-dominant to suspension-dominant behaviors as the Stokes number decreases, which gives rise to distinct deposit morphology in different regimes. Our ﬁndings enhance the understanding of inertial and viscous behaviors of immersed granular ﬂows. The veriﬁed scaling rules and dimensionless parameters are of potential use in small-scale experiments and simulations where appropriate scaling is essential.</p>

    <p>We perform coupled fluid-particle simulations to understand the granular collapse in an ambient fluid (in particular, water) with a wide range of initial aspect ratios. We observe both similar and distinct features in underwater collapses compared to their dry counterparts. As aspect ratio a increases, the normalized runout distance follows a piecewise power-law growth, transitioning at a=2.5. We associate this transition with the different growth rates of kinetic energy (with a) in vertical and horizontal directions. The ability of utilizing available energy for horizontal motion becomes limited when a\textgreater2.5. Moreover, the front propagation during underwater collapses can be well scaled by using the initial column height as length scale and considering a reduced gravity (due to buoyancy) in timescale. Under the reduced gravity, the initial fall of tall columns is found to be ballistic, consistent with dry collapses. On the other hand, underwater collapses (especially for large a) exhibit unique dynamics due to the presence of water. The eddies generated in water, which may carry considerable fluid inertia, tend to erode the surface of the granular layer, thus modifying the deposit morphology. The energy conversion is also affected by the ambient fluid. While water obviously consumes energy from the granular phase through fluid-particle interactions, it actually increases the efficiency of energy conversion from vertical to horizontal directions. The latter effect compensates the difference of runout distance between underwater and dry collapses.</p>

    <p>Through experiments and discrete particle method (DPM) simulations we present evidence for the existence of a recirculating structure, that exists near the front of dense granular avalanches, and is known as a breaking size-segregation (BSS) wave. This is achieved through the study of three-dimensional bidisperse granular ﬂows in a moving-bed channel. Particle-size segregation gives rise to the formation of a large-particle-rich front and a small-particle-rich tail with a BSS wave positioned between the tail and front. We experimentally resolve the structure of the BSS wave using refractive-index matched scanning and ﬁnd that it is qualitatively similar to the structure observed in DPM simulations. Our analysis demonstrates a relation between the concentration of small particles in the ﬂow and the amount of basal slip, in which the structure of the BSS wave plays a key role. This leads to a feedback between the mean bulk ﬂow velocity and the process of particle-size segregation. Ultimately, these ﬁndings shed new light on the recirculation of large and small grains near avalanche fronts and the effects of this behaviour on the mobility of the bulk ﬂow.</p>

    <p>Prediction of runout distance and deposit morphology is of great importance in hazard mitigation of geophysical ﬂows, including viscoplastic mudﬂows. The major rheological parameters of mudﬂows, namely, yield stress and viscosity, are crucial factors in controlling the runout and deposition processes. However, the roles of the two parameters, especially in mudﬂows with high inertia, remain poorly understood and are not accounted for in runout scaling relations with source volume. Here we investigate the eﬀects of ﬂow rheology on runout scaling and deposit morphology using small-scale laboratory experiments and three-dimensional numerical simulations. We ﬁnd that yield stress and viscosity both inﬂuence ﬂow velocity gained during downslope propagation of mudﬂows, which is strongly correlated with the runout distance; the role of yield stress is more signiﬁcant than viscosity. High yield stress and low viscosity lead to an elongated deposit, where longitudinal propagation is more signiﬁcant than lateral spreading. In contrast, high viscosity promotes the dominance of lateral spreading of the deposit, while low yield stress and moderate viscosity produce an initial elongate deposit, followed by a secondary surge that spreads laterally near the head of the deposit. Following appropriate scaling relations for viscosity and yield stress, a general scaling function is proposed to incorporate ﬂow properties in the well-known correlation of runout distance and source volume. Our ﬁndings regarding the inertia eﬀects and the roles of yield stress and viscosity enhance our understanding of mudﬂows, muddy debris ﬂows, and other viscoplastic geophysical ﬂows.</p>

    <p>Subsea pipelines, trenching picks and ploughing blades are examples where soil-structure interaction occurs at very low vertical effective stress. Arches are multi-particle structures encountered during the interface shearing process, the existence of which dictates the properties of the overall granular assembly. In order to understand the behavior of dense granular materials in response to shearing under low conﬁning pressure, physical modeling together with discrete element method (DEM) modeling of granular layers has been performed. Since friction can control the behaviors of granular ﬂow, this study focuses on the effect of μ on the arch network as a parametric study. Grains have been subjected to horizontal shearing by a triangle wedge at an enlarged scale so that observations of the shearing process and behavior of particles can be made. The model was validated against physical modeling by comparing the rearrangement of selected particles, velocity vector ﬁeld and arch network. During the shearing process, the arch network changed with the formation and collapse of arches, which was quantitatively analyzed in terms of arch size distribution and duration. The micromechanical responses from the granular assembly demonstrated that when μ increased, particle rearrangement shifted from sliding to rotation, resulting in longer and more durable arches. The investigation on contact forces showed that in-arch grains withstood larger forces and had a higher probability to participate in force chain than out-of-arch grains. Taking the effect of μ into consideration, the study explores the relationship among particle rearrangement, arch network, and force chains.</p>

    <p>Hydraulic fracturing in permeable rock is a complicated process which might be influenced by various factors including the operational parameters (e.g., fluid viscosity, injection rate and borehole diameter) and the in situ conditions (e.g., in situ stress states and initial pore pressure level). To elucidate the effects of these variables, simulations are performed on hollow-squared samples at laboratory scale using fully coupled discrete element method. The model is first validated by comparing the stress around the borehole wall measured numerically with that calculated theoretically. Systematic parametric studies are then conducted. Modeling results reveal that the breakdown pressure and time to fracture stay constant when the viscosity is lower than 0.002 Pa-s or higher than 0.2 Pa-s but increases significantly when it is between 0.002 and 0.2 Pa-s. Raising the injection rate can shorten the time to fracture but dramatically increase the breakdown pressure. Larger borehole diameter leads to the increase in the time to fracture and the reduction in the breakdown pressure. Higher in situ stress requires a longer injection time and higher breakdown pressure. The initial pore pressure, on the other hand, reduces the breakdown pressure as well as the time to fracture. The increase in breakdown pressure with viscosity or injection rate can be attributed to the size effect of greater tensile strength of samples with smaller infiltrated regions.</p>

Our results show that the submerged collapse leads to a shorter runout and thicker front due to the resistance provided by the ambient fluid. An interesting process of vortex formation is observed in the fluid as particles turn into a shear flow. At high aspect ratios, the vortex in water can significantly modify the surface morphology of the final deposit due to the fluid inertia developed on the surface of the granular layer.</p>

    <p>To understand the effect of size segregation in the depositional process of debris ﬂows, both ﬂume experiments at the laboratory scale and numerical simulations using the discrete element method (DEM) are performed. A variety of particle size distributions with coarse and ﬁne particles are adopted. It is found that larger particles tend to reach the front of the ﬁnal deposits, while small particles are accumulated at the tail of the ﬂows. Quantitative agreement is achieved in the DEM simulations, where rolling resistance and geometric roughness at boundaries are adopted to account for the effect of particle shape. With the DEM results, the effect of segregation on the runout distance is studied from the perspective of energy dissipation. The progress of segregation is analyzed in detail, which revealed that segregation occur slowly while the ﬂow is propagating rapidly over the slopes; it becomes signiﬁcant during the deposition stage, where more large particles are found near the surface. The effect of segregation in debris ﬂow deposition can help better predict the runout distance and impact pressure, which is crucial in the assessment and mitigation of debris ﬂow-related natural hazards.</p>

Particle rotation associated with shear is necessary for the upward migration of large particles. Segregation of large particles can be suppressed with inadequate friction, or with no rotation; increasing interparticle friction promotes the migration of large particles, but has little effect on the percolation of small particles.</p>

    <p>The geometric roughness at boundaries has a profound impact on the dynamics of granular flows. For a bumpy base made of fixed particles, two major factors have been separately studied in the literature, namely, the size and spatial distribution of base particles. A recent work (Jing et al. 2016) has proposed a roughness indicator R_a, which combines both factors for any arbitrary bumpy base comprising equally-sized spheres. It is shown in mono-disperse flows that as R_a increases, a transition occurs from slip (R_a &lt; 0.51) to non-slip (R_a &gt; 0.62) conditions. This work focuses on such a phase transition in bi-disperse flows, in which R_a can be a function of time. As size segregation takes place, large particles migrate away from the bottom, leading to a variation of size ratio between flow- and base-particles. As a result, base roughness R_a evolves with the progress of segregation. Consistent with the slip/non-slip transition in mono-disperse flows, basal sliding arises at low values of R_a and the development of segregation might be affected; when R_a increases to a certain level (R_a &gt; 0.62), non-slip condition is respected. This work extends the validity of R_a to bi-disperse flows, which can be used to understand the geometric boundary effect during segregation.</p>

	The basal condition for granular chute flows is assumed rough and non-slip in experimental and numerical studies. In mono-disperse flows, a rough base is usually constructed by gluing/fixing a layer of particles that is similar or identical to the flowing particles. However, the base condition is not so clear in bi-disperse flows, where size segregation changes the relative basal roughness. In this paper, basal effect is studied in both mono- and bi-disperse chute flows. Different size ratios are adopted to understand how size segregation affects the basal condition and velocity profile in the steady, fully developed state. It is found that considerable sliding may arise as large particles stay in contact with the base, and it may affect the development of segregation. The velocity profile at the steady state is different due to the occurrence of segregation. In addition, sensitivity analyses show that the basal effect is independent of the sample size and contact parameters.

	Base roughness plays an important role in the dynamics of granular flows but is still poorly understood due to the difficulty of its quantification. For a bumpy base made of spheres, at least two factors should be considered in order to characterize its geometric roughness, namely, the size ratio of flow to base particles and the packing arrangement of base particles. In this paper, we propose an alternative definition of base roughness, R_a, as a function of both the size ratio and the distribution of base particles. This definition is generalized for random and regular packings of multilayered spheres. The range of possible values of R_a is presented, and optimal arrangements for maximizing base roughness are studied. Our definition is applied to granular chute flows in both two- and three-dimensional configurations, and is shown to successfully predict whether slip occurs at the base. A transition is observed from slip to nonslip conditions as R_a increases. Critical values of R_a are identified for the construction of a nonslip base at various angles of inclination.

	Computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method (CFD–DEM) is extended with the volume of fluid (VOF) method to model free-surface flows. The fluid is described on coarse CFD grids by solving locally averaged Navier–Stokes equations, and particles are modelled individually in DEM. Fluid–particle interactions are achieved by exchanging information between DEM and CFD. An advection equation is ap- plied to solve the phase fraction of liquid, in the spirit of VOF, to capture the dynamics of free fluid surface. It also allows inter-phase volume replacements between the fluid and solid particles. Further, as the size ratio (SR) of fluid cell to particle diameter is limited (i.e. no less than 4) in coarse-grid CFD–DEM, a porous sphere method is adopted to permit a wider range of particle size without sacrificing the resolution of fluid grids. It makes use of more fluid cells to calculate local porosities. The developed solver (cfdemSolverVOF) is validated in different cases. A dam break case validates the CFD-component and VOF-component. Particle sedimentation tests validate the CFD–DEM interaction at various Reynolds numbers. Water-level rising tests validate the volume exchange among phases. The porous sphere model is validated in both static and dynamic situations. Sensitivity analyses show that the SR can be reduced to 1 using the porous sphere approach, with the accuracy of analyses maintained. This allows more details of the fluid phase to be revealed in the analyses and enhances the applicability of the proposed model to geotechnical problems, where a highly dynamic fluid velocity and a wide range of particle sizes are encountered.

		<p>Mudflows tend to deposit after a rapid evolution on the steep channel down hillside. The large runout distance and deposit area are crucial concerns of geotechnical and geological engineers. In the rheological point of view, mudflows are non-Newtonian viscoplastic fluids which behave like a solid until submitted to a higher stress than the yield strength. Upon yielding, flow takes place and the flow behavior is described by viscosity. How viscosity and yield stress control the deposition of mudflows remains yet unclear due to the difficulties of performing large-scale experiments and scaling over a wide range of length scales.</p>
		<p>In this work, scaling of rheological parameters are proposed in a dimensional analysis. It is successfully used in numerical simulations to bridge the depositional behaviors of mudflows at different scales. The numerical modeling with Bingham and Herschel-Bulkley models are validated against small-scale flume experiments. The depositional mechanism of mudflows is associated with yield stress and viscosity. It is found that a deposition of slurry relevant to natural mudflows has the following features: (i) fast runout and stoppage due to relatively low viscosity; (ii) elongated shape due to fast runout (more stream-wise spreading than lateral spreading); (iii) remains stuck on the channel and steep edges due to high yield stress; (iv) flat deposit surface due to the effect of yield stress.</p></p>

	Three-dimensional DEM simulations of size segregation in granular flows down chute are presented. Different cubic bi-disperse samples are generated by pluviation, on the rough base formed by randomly placed particles. Periodic boundaries are applied to the flow direction and the two sides. Parametrical studies involving slope angle, width, volume fraction, and coefficient of friction are systemically performed. In all presented cases, steady, fully developed (SFD) state is achieved, where the kinetic energy and fractional volume distribution remain constant. From the macroscopic view, segregations are completed in the SFD state with slightly different extents and a thick layer of pure coarse grains appears on the top of the flow. The profiles of volume fractions are calculated and presented by shear layers. In addition, the trajectories of individual particles are tracked and analysed, showing clearly the contact conditions and shear history experienced by individual particles. It is found that the connectivity of small particles is generally at a lower level than that of the large ones, indicating a high probability of small particles dropping into voids under gravity is higher. On the other hand, the large particles experience a significant increase of connectivity as they migrate through the layer of small particles.

	A coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics and Discrete Element Method (CFD-DEM) model is presented for fluid-particle flows with free fluid surface. The fluid flow is modeled by solving the locally averaged Navier-Stokes equations, and the particle motions are captured separately in the DEM. Fluid-particle interactions are taken into consideration by exchanging necessary information between the CFD and the DEM. A numerical solver, referred to as cfdemSolverVOF in this study, is developed to capture the dynamics of the free fluid surface within the CFD-DEM framework. This is achieved by applying an advection equation to solve the volume fraction of the liquid in each fluid cell, in the spirit of the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method. Different components of the developed numerical solver are verified and validated in the dam break case and sedimentation of particle tests. The numerical predictions agree well with the analytical/empirical solutions.
